(AI task #1)

first step in task #1 was to download ORACLE's Virtual Machine software on my PC
which i have downloaded from the official site.

Moving to step two which was to download UBUNTU, I have encountered a couple of issues with installing it and getting it 
to work properly, firstly I have downloaded version 22.04 which did not work properly with step three of task number 3, then I have installed version 20.04
Which worked well with step number 3.

Lastly Task #3, installing ROS sotfware on UBUNTU which will allow us to control robotics specifically in this task we will try to contol an arm.

These following resources helped me complete task #1:
